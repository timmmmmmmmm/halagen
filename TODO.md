# Halagen Label Generator - Todo List

## **CURRENT PRIORITIES** üöÄ

### ‚úÖ 1. Copy YAML Button Feature - COMPLETED
**Add toolbar button to export current single editor settings as YAML**
- ‚úÖ Add "Copy YAML" button to main toolbar
- ‚úÖ Extract current form values (text, dimensions, icons, alignment, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Convert to YAML format matching batch processor structure
- ‚úÖ Copy to clipboard with success notification
- ‚úÖ Helps users transition from single editor to batch processor

### 2. Shorter Footer - COMPLETED
**Reduce footer height by bringing attribution lines closer together**
- Move GitHub attribution and Ko-fi link closer together
- Reduce vertical spacing between footer elements
- Keep functionality but make more compact

### 3. Two Icons Option - COMPLETED
**Add support for displaying two icons on labels**
- Extend current icon count selector (0/1) to include 2 icons
- Show two identical icon selectors when "2 icons" is selected
- Update preview canvas to render both icons
- Adjust text layout to accommodate two icons
- Consider icon positioning (side-by-side or stacked)

### 4. Replace Column Icon with Text
**Change column selector icon to text labels**
- Replace current column icon with text "Main Columns" 
- Replace sub-column icon with text "Sub-Columns"
- Improve clarity of what each setting controls

### 5. Button Group Consistency
**Improve visual cohesion of width/height/column controls**
- Make width arrows visually part of input field group (Bootstrap input group)
- Make height arrows visually grouped (vertical button group if possible)
- Apply same grouping treatment to column number +/- buttons
- Ensure all arrow buttons are clearly clickable (not just on hover)

## **EXISTING REDDIT REQUESTS**

**Phase 1 Status:**
- ‚úÖ ~~UI Framework Migration (Bootstrap 5)~~ - *Implemented*
- üîÑ Icon Count Selection Feature (0/1/2 icons) - *Needs 2-icon support*
- ‚úÖ ~~Text centering~~ - *Implemented*
- ‚úÖ ~~Toggle second row~~ - *Implemented*

**Phase 2 (Enhanced functionality):**
- ‚è≥ Basic crimping icons
- ‚è≥ Icon overlay system
- ‚è≥ QR code integration

## **Future Considerations / Maybe Later**
- **Direct printing integration**: Enable direct printing to label printers without saving as PNG first
  - Would require integration with browser printing APIs or label printer SDKs
  - Complex implementation, uncertain browser support
  - Users can continue using current PNG ‚Üí label printer workflow

# Feature Details

## **UI Framework Migration**
**Move to Bootstrap 5 for better component system and styling**

**Implementation Plan:**
- Add Bootstrap 5 CSS to existing HTML (CDN or local copy)
- Migrate existing form controls to Bootstrap classes
- Update button styling to use Bootstrap button components
- Implement Bootstrap button groups for icon count selector
- Use Bootstrap grid system for better layout balance
- Update input fields to use Bootstrap form controls
- Maintain current functionality while improving visual consistency
- Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes

**Benefits:**
- Professional, consistent styling out of the box
- Ready-made components (button groups, form controls, modals)
- No build process required - works with current static setup
- Easier to implement future UI features

## **Icon Count Selection Feature**
**Addresses no-image mode and dual icon support requests**

**Implementation Plan:**
- Add icon count selector as Bootstrap-style button group with three buttons: `[0] [1] [2]`
- Position above height setting, left of width setting for UI balance
- Default state: 1 icon (current behavior)
- Button group styling: Connected buttons, active button highlighted, inactive buttons subdued

**Behavior per mode:**
- **0 Icons**: Hide all icon selectors, text area expands to full label width
- **1 Icon**: Current behavior, single icon selector visible
- **2 Icons**: Show two icon selectors (Icon 1, Icon 2), arrange side by side in label

**Layout adjustments:**
- 0 icons: Text spans full width, centered or left-aligned based on text alignment setting
- 1 icon: Current layout (icon left, text right)
- 2 icons: Icons positioned left side (stacked or side-by-side), text area adjusted accordingly

**UI considerations:**
- When switching from 2‚Üí1 icons, preserve Icon 1 selection, clear Icon 2
- When switching from 1‚Üí0 icons, hide icon selector but preserve selection for when user switches back
- Update preview canvas in real-time when mode changes

## **Text Centering/Justification**
Add center alignment option for text

## **Toggle Second Row**
Option to disable subtitle/subtext completely for single-line labels

## **Crimping/Electrical Icons**
Add ferrules, terminal connections, and other electrical component icons

## **Icon Overlay System**
Implement Cullenect-style overlays where tool interface icons are overlaid on bolt shapes

## **QR Code Integration**
Add QR codes to labels for linking to specifications, inventory systems, or part databases
   
**Implementation Plan:**
- Add "QR Code" section in label editor UI
- Input field with 20-25 character limit for reliable scanning at 12mm height
- Live character counter showing remaining characters  
- Helper text: "Use TinyURL.com to shorten long URLs"
- Real-time QR code preview as user types
- Use client-side QR library (qrcode.js or qrcode-generator)
- Position QR on right side of label, adjust text layout accordingly
- QR version 2-3 (25x25 to 29x29 modules) with error correction level L
- Disable QR generation if over character limit

## **Implementation Notes**
- The dual icon feature would work well with the existing fastener/head icon structure you already have
- The overlay concept could leverage your existing SVG head icons to create composite visuals
